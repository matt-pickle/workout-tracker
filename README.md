WHAT IT DOES:
I wanted a simple, organized way to track my weightlifting workouts and body weight. The "Current" page is where you enter the name of each lift, the weight, and the number of reps for as many sets as you want. It also includes a timer for timing your rests between sets. The "Workout Complete!" button saves the workout data to the browser's localStorage, which can be viewed on the "History" page. The "Weight" page is where you enter your current weight, which is saved under the current date and displayed in a line graph below.

WHAT I LEARNED:
Using React Router to set up a multi-page app
Using react-chartjs-2 to create a line graph
Responsive styling with CSS flexbox
Better code reusability (Button component)
Using state instead of CSS for button hover effects
Conditional rendering of components (Timer)
